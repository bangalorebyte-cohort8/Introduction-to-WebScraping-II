# Introduction-to-WebScraping-II
Selenium

For today's assignment, you must write a program using selenium which scrapes the first 2 pages of the search result of a keyword search on Amazon. For, example, if the keyword "books" was entered then the first two pages of the search results must be scraped.

In each of the two pages, I want you to scrape 3 elements from each item - Listing Name, Price and Ratings. These three elements should then be written to a CSV file with three columns.

I should be able to enter the keyword in the terminal (hint: use input()).
